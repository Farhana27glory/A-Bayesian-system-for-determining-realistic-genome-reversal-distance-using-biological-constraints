# A-Bayesian-system-for-determining-realistic-genome-reversal-distance-using-biological-constraints
I have implemented a Bayesian system for determining the realistic genome reversal distance using biological constraints. The system has been implemented using C++ and the experiments are done by Python. We used matplotlib and Seaborn libraries for generating the graphs from the experiments.
